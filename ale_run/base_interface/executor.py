"""BaseExecutor — substrate adapter that places + drives a deployer.

The framework recognises three Executor types (in :mod:`ale_run.executors`):

* :class:`LocalExecutor`   — run the deployer in the framework's own
                             Python process.
* :class:`DockerExecutor`  — ``docker run`` a fresh container per unit,
                             ship the deployer + ALE source into it,
                             entrypoint runs the deployer in-container.
* :class:`SandboxExecutor` — upload and extract an ALE source archive in the
                             sandbox VM, then start a bootstrap that runs
                             the deployer inside the sandbox itself.

What the executor IS to a deployer
----------------------------------

A passive data carrier. The deployer's ``__init__(executor)`` reads
``executor.work_dir / sandbox / config / env`` and operates with **Python
stdlib only** (``subprocess`` / ``pathlib`` / ``json`` / ``asyncio``).
The deployer never calls the three abstract methods below — those are
the **lifecycle's** handle on the substrate, not the deployer's.

What the executor IS to the lifecycle
-------------------------------------

Three methods:

* :meth:`run_deployer`   — place + run the deployer end-to-end;
                           return an :class:`AgentRunResult`.
* :meth:`gather_dir`     — bulk-pull ``src`` (substrate-native path)
                           into ``dst`` (host directory). No-op when
                           ``src`` is already a host path.
* :meth:`download_range` — incremental ranged read of a single file on
                           the substrate. Used by hot-artifact tailing.

Cross-OS deployer contract
--------------------------

The Sandbox executor's substrate may be linux OR windows (per
:attr:`SandboxHandle.os`). Deployer code is responsible for its own OS
dispatch using ``self.executor.sandbox.os``; the framework does not
abstract this.

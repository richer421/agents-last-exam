"""CodexConfig: per-episode knobs for the OpenAI Codex CLI deployer.

The deployer ensures the running codex is exactly the pinned **fork** build
(``fork_version``, e.g. ``codex-cli 0.0.0-agenthle-20260614``): it compares
``codex --version`` and, when the binary is missing/stale/stock, installs stock
``@openai/codex`` from NPM (if needed) and overlays the fork native binary from
the GitHub Release; a matching version skips the download. The fork = openai/codex
``main`` merged in, plus two carries: the Windows ``apply_patch.exe`` hardlink
fix and the OpenRouter MCP adaptation (namespaced-tool flatten + dispatch
remap). Built from cua-verse/codex ``agenthle``; published as the release below.

Auth: OpenRouter routing uses ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` injected via env.
Direct OpenAI routing uses ``OPENAI_API_KEY``.
